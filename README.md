## How to Upload ?
1. Fork This Repository and clone it to your desktop.
2. Make a folder under your name and append all the files in that folder.
3. Commit the changes in your personal forked repository.
4. Submit a pull request thereafter.

## Basic Guidelines
Make sure your repository dosen't contain any copied or copywrited material. If found so, the files will be removed and the evaluation will be termed default.  
Try to use proper folder structure and indentations.  
Try to comment features for inline description of the working of the function. Not mandatory but helps.  
Must create a **README.md** file under your folder, containing the abstract of your program/function/code. Along with necessary details for *testing or integration*.
